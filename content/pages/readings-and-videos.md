*Come to class ready to discuss these discussion questions:*

1. Lijphart distinguishes between majoritarian and consensus democracies. What might you see as the principal advantages and disadvantages of each of these two broad models? What do you think of his argument (p.7) that “consensus democracy may be considered more democratic than majoritarian in most respects”?
2. Majoritarian democracies are associated with first-past-the-post electoral systems, while consensus democracies are associated with proportional representation. What accounts for these affinities? And what are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these electoral systems? What do each of these systems do well, and not so well?
3. What are the major differences Kemp identifies between the industrialization in Britain and in Germany?
4. Industrialization requires a labor force, which in turn means moving people off the land and into cities and factories. What are the core differences between how this process played out in Britain and Germany?
5. What does Kemp mean when he refers to Germany’s benefitting from its “latecomer status”?
6. What is the difference between socialism and social democracy?

*Come prepared to discuss the discuss these questions (and make sure you are able to identify all the terms at the end of the Bowman chapter):*

1. Hall and Soskice distinguish liberal from coordinated market economies. What are the major differences? What is comparative institutional advantage, in their argument? What are the comparative strengths of each of the two models they identify? What are they good at, what are they bad at?
2. Esping Andersen’s liberal welfare regime type is associated especially with the “liberal market economies” (as defined by Hall/Soskice), and his “Christian continental” and “Social Democratic” welfare regimes are associated with Lijphart’s “consensus” model. Why might that be?
3. Why might different education systems “go with” different varieties of capitalism? How might these different education systems contribute to outcomes such as competitiveness? Inequality?
